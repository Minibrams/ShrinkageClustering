# Shrinkage Clustering
A Python implementation of the Shrinkage Clustering algorithm presented in [*Shrinkage Clustering: a fast and size-constrained clustering algorithm for biomedical applications* by Chenyue W. Hu, Hanyang Li, and Amina A. Qutub](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5782397/). 

Data
----
A small test data file can be found in `data/clusters`. It contains 600 points (x, y) assigned to three clusters. 
The clusters are formed as seen below: 
In the file, every line contains three integers (x, y, assigned cluster number).
